## Lets have a look on a parts in architecture:

### 1.Requests:
### * Clients send requests to web-server
### * Requests can be:
####                1. query for data
####                2. deleting data
####                3. updating data

## * Node-js is a server side platform that takes requests from users, process those requests and returns responses to the corresponding users.
